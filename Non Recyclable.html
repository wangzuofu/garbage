        <h2> Kitchen waste</h2>
           <li> It includes food waste such as leftovers, bones, vegetable roots, and peels. Bio-technical treatment of compost can produce 0.6~0.7 tons of organic fertilizer per ton.</li>

            <li> It includes hard-to-recycle waste such as brick and ceramics, muck, toilet paper, paper towels, etc., as well as shells, dust, and food bags (boxes). Sanitary landfills can effectively reduce pollution to groundwater, surface water, soil and air.

            <h4> toilet paper</h4>
            <li>oilet paper and toilet paper dissolve in water, not counting the "paper" that can be recycled, but also the cigarette case.
Kitchen garbage bagging
Commonly used plastic bags, even if they can be degraded, are far more difficult to corrode than kitchen waste. In addition, the plastic bag itself is recyclable. The correct approach should be to dump the kitchen waste into the trash can, and throw the plastic bag into the “recyclable garbage” bucket.
